## Registration
1. Text Hyrum with names and ages of participants (recommended ages 12+ with an adult)!  To keep logistics simple, we may have to limit to the first 25 participants.

## Safety
<p style="color:red">While we have selected the safest parts of the river for the float and street for the bike ride, and have run the coarse ourselves, it does have hazards, especially for children.  Children must be accompanied by an adult and follow instructions of volunteer guides.  You participate at your own risk.</p>
1. All contestants will start each leg together.  At the end of each leg, we'll wait for everyone before continuing.
2. Life preservers are required for the river portion.
3. Especially for the swim and bike portions, we require an adult to accompany each child under 12 so that you don't miss the "exit" on the river, or a take a wrong turn during the biking.
4. Prior to the bike ride, there will be water available.
<p style="color:red"><b>Swimming hazards</b></p>
Follow the river guides!
- Swift current and deep portions that include eddies
- Shallow portions that present bruising danger from rocky riverbottom
- Tree branches and/or submerged trees
- If you miss the "exit" from the river, there are fewer convenient places to exit.  Follow the river guides!
<p style="color:red"><b>Biking hazards</b></p>
Follow the guides!
- The coarse is not marked.

- There is small stretch of downhill on Linder road that includes significant traffic, with a narrow sidewalk.


## Setup / Cleanup
1. Bikes should be dropped off at Grandma's house on Saturday morning before the race.  More details after registering.
2. We may want 2 adults to stay behind shuttle cars from the starting line the finish line (parking lot), and cheer contestants as they pass the finish line.
3. Life preservers may be left, but should be picked up from Grandma's house after the race.
4. Bring your own lunch for the end-of-tri picnic at Eagle Island state park.
