## Running dos and don'ts

### Do run anytime in May, following a “course” of your choosing
Complete 19 miles at a time and in a way of your choosing.   (Not a runner and want to participate? Run or walk. All at once or across several days.  Your 19-run memorial run could happen in four 4.75 miles morning runs, for example. )

### Do obey local laws and regulations
Please participate at a time and at a course that follows local regulations.  If you should not run, don’t.

### Do run by yourself
Keep appropriate social distancing measures.  Some research suggests that runners should keep 30 feet behind a runner headed the same direction since a droplets from the lead runner can close the gap at nearer distances in the runner’s wake.  While social distancing cautions remain, you really shouldn’t be meeting up with a running buddy, let alone a large running club.

### Do try running “off-the-beaten path” and at “off-peak” hours
Your 19-mile run might be a circuitous path through quiet neighborhoods near your home.  To keep an appropriate social distance in urban areas, try running at off-peak hours.  

### Do not run if you are sick
Not just for your own health, but others as well, wait until you are healthy to join in the COVID-19 memorial run.  

### Do share your run
Consider sharing your run on social media.  For example, [tweet](https://twitter.com/compose/tweet) “Just completed my #covid19memorialrun in Atlanta.  CC: @Covid19Run”
