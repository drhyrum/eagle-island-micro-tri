## Registration
1. Text Hyrum!

## Safety
1. All contestants will start each leg together.  At the end of each leg, we'll wait for everyone before continuing.
2. Life preservers are required for the river portion.
3. Especially for the swim and bike portions, we require an adult to accompany each child under 12 so that you don't miss the "exit" on the river, or a take a wrong turn during the biking.
4. Prior to the bike ride, there will be water available.

## Setup / Cleanup
1. Bikes should be dropped off at Grandma's house on Saturday morning before the race.
2. We may want 2 adults to stay behind shuttle cars from the starting line the finish line (parking lot), and greet contestants as they pass the finish line.
3. Life preservers may be left, but should be picked up from Grandma's house after the race.
4. Bring your own lunch for the end-of-tri picnic at Eagle Island state park.
